# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
The method used to execute peer download and upload in parallel was forking.
Everytime we want to upload or download a file we fork the process and have
the child process do the file upload and download while the parent process
continues on with its execution

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
1. If someone requests for a file with a name whose length is larger than
   FILENAMESIZ then it will cause a buffer overrun bug. A fix for this case
   is to detect it and then to terminate the request as we will be unable to
   locate files with names that large. 


# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)
1. Fixed the bug where a peer could try to access a file not in the current
   directory. Was able to detect this if they put a '/' inside of the file
   name
2. There is a bug that occurs when many peers are logged in at once. The
   reason for this is because when we send a WANT request a bunch of these
   peers will be returned because they all have the file; however, this will
   fill up our buffer and will cause an error. 
3. Fixed the bug where a peer could send us extremely large files by
   defining a constant MAX_FILE_SIZE equal to 2 GB and terminating the
   download if the file exceeds this limit.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)
1. Our first attack will upload a continuous stream of data to our victim.
   If they have nothing in place to catch unusually large file sizes then
   this data will eventually fill up their available memory causing their
   system to crash.
2.
